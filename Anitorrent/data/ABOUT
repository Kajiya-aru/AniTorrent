## About AniTorrent
---
This app has been developed by **kajiya_aru** with the sole purpose of replacing the poor search and indexing system of Nyaa.si, and there is no profit-seeking behind it. All of the material available on AniTorrent is externally hosted and I do not own nor make any profit off it.  
Updates will keep coming, but any kind of help/sponsor will be appreciated as mantaining the app takes time and effort. If you like AniTorrent, don't hesitate to help me or give me a **star** on my GitHub page.


## Usage
---
Using AniTorrent is really straight and easy:
* On the main page, select the sources you want to search on (more on this on **AVAILABLE SOURCES**) and enter the name.
* Once selected the show and source, a new page will pop up containing all the available episodes and/or specials with extra info. You can filter by quality of the shows.
* After selecting the episodes to download, press the _Download_ button and the torrents will be automatically managed and renamed by the app.
* If you wish to mantain the torrent active after the download, select **_Cancel Postprocessing_** on the Configuration.

## Schedules
---
Schedules for airing anime are provided.
* On the Airing Today window, shows and airing time are provided.
* On the weekly schedule, shows are ordered based on their MyAnimeList rating.  

Clicking on any show will autocomplete the Search Bar.
