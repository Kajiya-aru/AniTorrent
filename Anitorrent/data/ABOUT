<h2 id="about-anitorrent">About AniTorrent</h2>
<p>This app has been developed by <strong>kajiya_aru</strong> with the sole purpose of replacing the poor search and indexing system of Nyaa.si, and there is no profit-seeking behind it. All of the material available on AniTorrent is externally hosted and I do not own nor make any profit off it.  </p>
<p>Updates will keep coming, but any kind of help/sponsor will be appreciated as mantaining the app takes time and effort. If you like AniTorrent, don&#39;t hesitate to help me or give me a <strong>star</strong> on my GitHub page.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
